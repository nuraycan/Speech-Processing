## LPC (linear predictive coefficients) Analysis 

This project aims to do Linear Predictive Coding analysis and synthesis for two different speech signals. We used 2 utterances which are mono recorded speeches.We used the Matlab’s own ‘lpc.m’ function to analyze the speech files firstly. This analyze gives us the LPC coefficients and gains and we wrote a function ‘syn_lpc.m’ to synthesize this speech by using these LPC coefficients and gains. LPC is good for characterizing the general spectral shape of a signal, which may be time-varying as in speech sounds. For synthesis, any source can be filtered, allowing the general spectral shape of one signal (used in analysis) to be applied to any source. For these reasons we try to do implementation of LPC of speech. For more details look at LPCReport.pdf file.
